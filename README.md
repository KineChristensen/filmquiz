# FilmQuiz (school project)

School project from spring 2019 in the course Webutvikling 2.

Movie quiz application. The user must answer 10 questions about movies. They get 4 answer alternatives
on every question. If they answer correctly they get a higher score. If they answer wrong, they get a penalty.
After the last question the final score and how many right answers they got are revealed to the user.

(The whole project was done spring 2019 on my local machine only, so this repo contains very few commits :( )
